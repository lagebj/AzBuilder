# AzBuilder

AzBuilder is a PowerShell module that enables you to manage your Azure infrastructure using a "Bring-Your-Own-ARM-Template" approach. It allows you to organize the template files in a folder hierarchy adapted to your business context. It is well suited to be used in CI/CD pipelines.

## How it works

AzBuilder enumerates a folder structure and determines based on existing Azure environment and contents of the folder what to deploy.

### The functions

#### Build-AzBuilderTemplate

This function prepares the ARM templates for deployment.

#### Invoke-AzBuilderDeployment

This function invokes the deployment of ARM templates.

#### Move-AzBuilderTemplate

This function moves successfully deployed ARM templates to a `.deployments` folder in the respective scope.

### Folder structure

A folder structure is enumerated by AzBuilder and it interpretes the hierarchy based on how the folder structure is set up. For AzBuilder to be successful in interpreting the hierarchy, there are a couple of rules to follow:

- Folders representing subscriptions must be named the same as the subscription ID it represents.
    - Example subscription folder name: `b8701a61-1dad-42cc-92db-caa52415ca8c`
- Folders representing resource groups must have the resource group location in parenthesis in the folder name.
    - Example resource group folder name: `rg-mgmt (westeurope)`

AzBuilder interpretes the folder structure in the following manner:

- The root folder is interpreted as the default `Tenant Root Group`.
- Any folders containing a **GUID** is considered a subscription representation.
- Any folder containing **parenthesis** is considered a resource group representation.

AzBuilder checks current Azure environment and verifies if management groups and resource groups exists. If management groups and/or resource groups defined in the hierarchy does not exist in Azure, these are automatically deployed without needing to add ARM templates for them.

#### Example folder structure

ðŸ“¦c:\temp\AzBuilder-root
 â”£ ðŸ“‚azb
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚azb-decommissioned
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚azb-landingzones
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚azb-corp
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚b6d0fd4f-30b4-4cc4-88dd-39d84c5d881a
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚rg-app (westeurope)
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚azb-online
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚azb-platform
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚azb-connectivity
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚azb-identity
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚azb-management
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚1fb67e23-8f99-41e9-99bf-33236d129fba
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚rg-mgmt (northeurope)
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œsolution_AgentHealthAssessment.json
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œsolution_AgentHealthAssessment.parameters.json
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œpolicyAssignment_Deploy-LogAnalytics.json
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œpolicyAssignment_Deploy-LogAnalytics.parameters.json
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œroleAssignment_Deploy-LogAnalytics.json
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œroleAssignment_Deploy-LogAnalytics.parameters.json
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚azb-sandboxes
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œpolicyDefinition_Deploy-ASC-Standard.json
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œpolicyDefinition_Deploy-ASC-Standard.parameters.json
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œpolicyDefinition_Deploy-LogAnalytics.json
 â”— â”— ðŸ“œpolicyDefinition_Deploy-LogAnalytics.parameters.json

In the example above, the root folder is `c:\temp\AzBuilder-root` and is considered as `Tenant Root Group`. The folder `azb` is considered a management group and subfolders `azb-decommissioned`, `azb-landingzones`, `azb-platform` and `azb-sandboxes` are considered child management groups to `azb`.

Folders `azb-corp` and `azb-online` are considered child management groups to `azb-landingzones` and `azb-connectivity`, `azb-identity` and `azb-management` are considered child management groups to `azb-platform`.

Folders `b6d0fd4f-30b4-4cc4-88dd-39d84c5d881a` and `1fb67e23-8f99-41e9-99bf-33236d129fba` represents two different subscriptions and are child subscriptions to `azb-corp` and `azb-management` respectively.

Folders `rg-app (westeurope)` and `rg-mgmt (northeurope)` represents resource groups in subscriptions `b6d0fd4f-30b4-4cc4-88dd-39d84c5d881a` and `1fb67e23-8f99-41e9-99bf-33236d129fba`.

The ARM templates in the example will be provisioned at the scope they are represented in the hierarchy. That means that templates `policyDefinition_Deploy-ASC-Standard.json` and `policyDefinition_Deploy-LogAnalytics.json` will be deployed to management group `azb`. Template files `policyAssignment_Deploy-LogAnalytics.json` and `roleAssignment_Deploy-LogAnalytics.json` will be deployed to management group `azb-management`. Template `solution_AgentHealthAssessment.json` will be deployed to resource group `rg-mgmt`.

### ARM templates

AzBuilder parses all template files in the hierarchy and deploys them at their respective scope. It expects to have a `parameters.json` file accompanying all templates and skips any templates that does not have an accompanying parameters file. That means that you have to have a parameters file even thought your ARM template does not have any parameters, in that case the parameters file does not need to have any parameters specified either.

#### Dependencies

You can specify dependencies to resources that will be deployed at the same scope in the same operation by specifying the template file name without the `.json` extension.

Example
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-08-01/managementGroupDeploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
    "managementGroupName": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "variables": {},
  "resources": [
    {
      "name": "[guid(concat(parameters('managementGroupName'), 'Deploy-LogAnalytics'))]",
      "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments",
      "apiVersion": "2020-04-01-preview",
      "dependsOn": [
        "policyAssignment_Deploy-LogAnalytics"
      ],
      "properties": {
        "principalType": "ServicePrincipal",
        "roleDefinitionId": "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/8e3af657-a8ff-443c-a75c-2fe8c4bcb635",
        "principalId": "[toLower(reference(extensionResourceId(tenantResourceId('Microsoft.Management/managementGroups', parameters('managementGroupName')), 'Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments', 'Deploy-LogAnalytics'), '2018-05-01', 'Full').identity.principalId)]"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Successful deployments

If deployments are successful, you can use `Move-AzBuilderTemplate` to

## Getting Started

Install from the PSGallery and Import the module

    Install-Module AzBuilder
    Import-Module AzBuilder

## Limitations

There are some limitations when using AzBuilder for deployment. Any help on these are greatly appreciated, please feel free to contribute.

- AzBuilder does not support creation of subscriptions. This means that subsciptions will have to be created by other means before AzBuilder can be used to deploy resources at subscription or resource group level.
- AzBuilder does not support tagging of Resource Groups.
- ARM Template can not contain a parameter named `input`.
